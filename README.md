# numberProcess
A client uses a dashboard to input a number between 1 and 25. This number is automatically multiplied by 7. The resultant value is categorized into one of four logical files based on its size:

    File A: For values greater than 140.
    File B: For values greater than 100.
    File C: For values greater than 60.
    File D: For all other values.

Once a number is stored in each of the four files, no further inputs are allowed, and the process is considered complete. The system should also provide a list of all numbers saved in each file.
